      <p class="lead">        Con 2 Win (also known as Antichess) is a chess variant in which the

objective of each player is to lose all of his pieces or be stalemated.

Losing chess is one of the most popular of all chess variants.

Rules:

The rules are the same as those for standardÂ chess, except for

the following special rules:

 Capturing is compulsory.

 When more than one capture is available, the player may

choose.

 TheÂ kingÂ has noÂ royal powerÂ and accordingly.

 It may be captured like any other piece.

 There is noÂ checkÂ orÂ checkmate.

 There is noÂ castling.

 In addition to its normalÂ promotionÂ options, a pawn may

promote to a king.

 StalemateÂ is a win for the stalemated player.

 When a player has only a pawn remaining, and the pawn

is blocked from advancing, the opponent gets unlimited

moves until the pawn is freed.

A player wins by losing all his pieces, or being stalemated.

Apart fromÂ move repetition,Â draw by agreement, and theÂ fifty-

move rule, the game is also drawn when a win is impossible

(such as if a dark-squaredÂ bishopÂ and a light-squared bishop

are the only pieces remaining).

NOTE:

                     Organizers have every right to disqualify the

game if it is not according to the rules and regulations and

also if the participants are found tampering with the

conduct.
