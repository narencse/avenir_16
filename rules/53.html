      <p class="lead">        Can u sing? Do you think that all the people in the world

would listen to you, singing and would stop whatever they

were doing for a while and would want to give a thought

about the idea that a song tends to? Can u sketch? and can

you sketch the face of an idea? Can u act? Do u think a

satire can be powerful enough to change the world? Can u

dance? Can you prove that the ideas are not captivated but

they are free, they are invulnerable? Can you speak and

want people to listen to you, while you analyze a picket

line? Or, you only want to do your job so that people can

forget about life for a while? Its time you hit the streets!

After the grand success in the previous year, Avenir is back

with Free Wheelinâ€™.

We believe that all the art forms are somehow related if

they are driven by a particular idea. Out here, we will

provide you with a theme/idea/topic, which you have to

implicate in your performance. As this whole idea is

inspired from \'Nukkads\' and street arts, and the radical


cultural revolution of the sixties, we will provide you with a

street corner like atmosphere. No mikes, no amplifiers!

This event has two rounds:

l Preliminary Round The Winning teams/participants will be

eligible for the Final round.

l The Final Round â€“ Winning teams of the Prelims and those

from Aahvaahan (for students of Netaji Subhash

Engineering College students only) will be eligible for this

round.

RULES and REGULATIONS (same for both the

rounds):

l An idea/theme/topic will be provided; participants have to

implement that very idea through their performances.

l Any form of art is allowed and welcome! People can Sing, sing

in groups, play instruments, sketch, paint, speak, act and

direct charades (one-act dramas), recite, dance, dance in

groups etc. But key point is you have to implement the

given theme through whatever you want to do.

l People from different institution can team up and

participate. All you need is a college ID card.

l Offensive languages will lead a participant to

disqualification.

l Time limit for each performance is 10+1 minutes.
