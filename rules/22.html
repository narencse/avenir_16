Design an autonomous vehicle which is capable of following black line on a white surface.

? General Rules:

â€¢ The participant must be a regular student of AICTE approved /UGC recognized Technical or

Management Institute.

â€¢ All students must have a valid identity card of their respective educational institute.

â€¢ Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be eliminated from the competition

automatically.

â€¢ The team must adhere to the spirit of healthy competition. Judges reserve the right to disqualify

any team indulged in misbehavior.

â€¢ Certificate of excellence will be awarded to all the winners.

â€¢ Participants from different institutes may form a team.

â€¢ Event rules can be subjected to change.

â€¢ Damaging any property (arena/systems) will lead to the disqualification.

â€¢ Participants should not have any objection on the predefined rules.

â€¢ Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.

â€¢Involvement of a participant in two teams is strictly prohibited,

violating this rule will lead to disqualification of both the teams.

? ROBOT specification and Gameplay:-

â€¢The microcontroller on-board must be an 8-bit microcontroller

â€¢ Line will be of 2 cm width.

â€¢ There will be numerous breaks in the path(maximum gap-3.5 to 4 cm) The bot has to check the next

available route and follow that.

â€¢ Check points are horizontal strip of black lines of  length 8/9cm and width 2 cm, the bot has to detect

the strip by glowing led or buzzer.

â€¢ The room in which the event will take place will be relatively dark.

â€¢ Maximum team size must be 4 members.

â€¢ The event consists of two rounds: â€“ Elimination round and the Final round.

â€¢ The track will consist of sharp(90 and obtuse turn) as well as smooth turns.

â€¢ Nudging/Pushing or any type of manual handling of the robot will lead to cancellation of that run.

â€¢ The path will of black colour on a white background.
