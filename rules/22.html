<br>
<br>	  The objective of this contest is for an autonomous robot to follow a black line 

on a white background, without losing the line, and navigating several 90 degree turns. The robot to 

complete the course in the shortest period of time while accurately tracking the course line from start 

to finish wins. 
<br>
<br><b>
Team specification: 
</b>
<br>
<br>
1. Maximum 4 members per team. 
<br>
2. Students from different colleges, sections, stream and years can form a team. 
<br>
3. Only one bot per team will be allowed and no two team will be allowed to share their bots. 
<br>
4. No person shall be associated with two teams. 
<br>
5. Use of Cell phone or Camera by the Participants at the arena is not allowed. 
<br>
Arena Specifications: 111cm wide by 2448cm long 
<br>
<br><b>
ROBOT SPECIFICATIONS: 
</b>
<br>
<br>
• The robot must be completely autonomous. It should not receive any help from humans during the 

course of its run. 
<br>
• The robots should have the capability to process data on-board. No remotely kept computer should 

control the robot. 
<br>
• The robot has to be developed and designed by the team itself. The usage of commercially available 

sensors, development boards is allowed, but it is forbidden to use a complete robotic system which is 

sold ready for the purpose of the competition (like LEGO kits). 
<br>
• The size of the robot must not exceed 22cm * 22cm * 22cm. Individual parameters to be measured. 
<br>
• Robots or participants must not damage the tournament area. 
<br>
• The robot may use on board battery, or using adapters of 9-12V, max 1A. 
<br>
• In case of external power supplies, the wire must slag all the time, pulling wires to alter the 

movement of the robots WILL NOT BE TOLERATED at all and the responsible team will be 
<br>
DISQUALIFED. The extension cords have to be arranged by the participants. 
<br>
<br><b>
Competition Rules 
</b><br>
<br>
1. The time of any run is measured from the time the robot starts moving from the point marked 

“START” until the time it crosses the point marked “FINISH”. A robot is deemed to have crossed 

the line when the forward most wheel of the robot contacts or crosses over the line. 
<br>
2. The robot has to detect the check point and glow a LED or ring a buzzer.50 points to be credited 

and in case of false detection 50 points to be deducted. 
<br>
3. Maximum time limit for the robot to complete the arena is 3 minutes. 
<br>
4. Each team will be provided with 20 mins of calibration time prior to their trial runs. 
<br>
5. Each team is allowed to take two trial runs and one final runs. 
<br>
6. Participants are never allowed to touch the arena. Any damage to the arena will lead to 

DISQUALIFICATION. 
<br>
7. A team can take a maximum of 2 TIMEOUTS of 2 min each. The robot will start from the last 

checkpoint in case it takes a TIMEOUT. The teams can check the calibration and other physical 

parts of the robot at this time. But programming the robot is NOT ALLOWED. A penalty of 50 

points will be imposed for each TIMEOUT taken. 
<br>
8. At any point if a team takes HANDTOUCH a penalty of 50 points will be imposed. Timer won’t 

stop on such occasions. 
<br>
9. A team may take a maximum of 1 RESTART. The robot will start again from the “START” point 

and the timer will be RESET. It will be considered as a NEW RUN. The teams can check the 

calibration and other physical parts of the robot at this time. But programming the robot is NOT 

ALLOWED. But teams taking a RESTART will incur a penalty of 100 points. 
<br>
10. The competition consists of 2 rounds.
