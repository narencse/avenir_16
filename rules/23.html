      <p class="lead">        PROBLEM STATMENT:

Design a manually controlled mechanical bot, which can push or kick a medium sized plastic ball.

The prime motive of this game is to push or kick the ball in opponent\'s goalpost and avoid the ball

from going into yours. Confinement of the ball by any sort of mechanism of the bot for more than

10 seconds will be treated as penalty.

-The bot taking less time will be qualified. (Round 1)

-The bot with more goals (point) will win the game. (Knockout and finals).

 NOTE-IF A KNOCKOUT MATCH REMAINS GOAL LESS THEN THE TEAM WHICH TOOK LESS TIME TO

QUALIFY FOR THE KNOCKOUTS WILL GO FOR THE NEXT ROUND.TIME ALLOTED FOR KNOCKOUTS

IS 4 MINUTES

ROUND 1:

It will be a time trial round where the bot needs to score goals by passing some obstacles (defenders)

in minimum time. A number of balls will be there in different parts of the arena and the bot will have

to put all the balls inside the goalpost.

ROUND 2:

Top 32 teams will be selected from the first round on the basis of best timing of round 1 and then one

to one knockout match will be played. Points will be more if the bot can score the goal from the

penalty box. Moving goal keeper will be present in this round (a part of the arena).if the bot can

score without hitting the goalkeeper, then more points!!!

NOTE- THE KNOCKOUT AND THE ROUND OF TOP 16 WILL BE PLAYED ON THE 2ND DAY AND THE

QUARTER FINAL, SEMI FINAL AND THE FINAL ON THE 3RD DAY.

SELECTED TEAMS WILL BE NOTIFIED. THE TEAMS ARE ALSO REQUESTED TO FOLLOW THE

FACEBOOK PAGE FOR THE UPDATES
