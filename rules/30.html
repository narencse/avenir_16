      <p class="lead">        Theory is the base for any invention and engineering work, but without practical application it does

not have any value. Practical knowledge is the thing which distinguishes Engineers from the rest.
<br>
Now-a-days Microprocessors are being extensively used in various industries and a good

knowledge of the same is very essential. So let us dive into assembly language programming and

see which one of us can crack the code!!
