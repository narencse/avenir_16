      <p class="lead">        Theory is the base for any invention and engineering work, but without practical application it does

not have any value. Practical knowledge is the thing which distinguishes Engineers from the rest.

Now-a-days Microprocessors are being extensively used in various industries and a good

knowledge of the same is very essential. So let us dive into assembly language programming and

see which one of us can crack the code!!

Rules and Regulations:

 The complete event is an on spot event and all the rounds would be held at Netaji

Subhash Engineering College,Kolkata during Avenir 2014.

 Mnemonics is restricted to students currently pursuing their education in any recognized

educational institute.

 A maximum of 3 participants can combine to form a team.

 Students from different colleges can be a part of the same team.

 The competition will be held in three stages

Rounds:

Round 1 ~

 This round will consist of 30 multiple choice questions related to microprocessor 8085 and

its peripherals. Each team will have to solve these questions in the given time.

 The top 10 teams to qualify this round will go to next level.

Round 2 ~

 In this round each team will be required to solve an interfacing problem related

to Microprocessor 8085 and its peripherals.

 Teams will be given a kit in which they have to show their output for the problem. Each

team has to finish it within the given amount of time.

Round 3 ~

 In this round judges will ask some question related to Microprocessor 8085 and its

peripherals.

Judging Parameters:

Final mark will be calculated on the basis of rounds 2 and 3. Decisions of judges will be final in this

regard. </p></div>
