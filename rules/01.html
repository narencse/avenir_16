Forbidden Moves:

The following rules must be observed:

 The players must kick-off with a backward pass at the beginning of each half and after every

goal is scored.

 The players are not allowed to shoot the ball directly onto the crossbar from a corner kick

in order to get a chance for a header when the ball rebounds.

 It is not allowed to score a goal from one\'s own half of the field.

 It is forbidden to make a throw-in directly into the opponent\'s penalty area. Should a player

throw the ball directly into the opponent\'s penalty area he shall be warned. Should he

persist, he shall be disqualified from the tournament. Any goals resulting from a throw-in

into the opponent\'s penalty area will not be counted.

 If a player changes his tactics, formation or line-up he has to kick the ball out of bounds after

the changes so that his opponent is able to react.

 There is a bug in FIFA 09 where the ball sometimes enters the goal from the top of the

crossbar or from the top or side of the net, and FIFA 09 (PC) considers it a goal. Should such

bug occur during a match, the player should take note and, at the end of the match, call a

referee to confirm the bug with the use of the in-game replay. Should this bug be confirmed,

the admin will make an appropriate call.

 In any case, a goal scored due to the use of a FORBIDDEN MOVE shall not be counted.
        
         Should a player persist in playing with forbidden moves, he may be disqualified from the
        
        tournament.
        
        Disconnections:
        
         Disconnection: any connection loss between opponents due to system, network, PC, and/or
        
        power problems/issues.
        
         Intentional disconnection: any connection loss between opponents due to a player\'s actions.
        
        Upon judgment by the referee, the offending player may be charged with a default loss.
        
         Should a disconnection occur:
        
         A referee will confirm the exact score to that point (even if the ball is about to cross the
        
        goal line, the goal shall not count), and restart the match.
        
         A referee will inform the players on exactly how many minutes must still be played in
        
        order to complete the match.
        
         Any players sent off the field (red card) shall count as a goal each for the opponent when
        
        the match resumes.
        
         If the disconnection occurs after a corner kick was awarded to a player, the match will
        
        resume with a corner kick for that same player.
        
        Unfair play:
        
        The following actions will be considered unfair play:
        
         The use of any cheat program
        
         An intentional disconnection
        
         The use of any settings exceeding the standard and permitted settings
        
         Clearly allowing one\'s opponent to win a match.
        
         Unsportsmanlike behavior or, in general, disruptive (e.g., shouting), inappropriate and/or
        
        unprofessional actions directed towards another player (even inside the game).
        
         Upon discovery of any player committing any violations regarded as unfair play, the
        
        offending player, at the sole discretion of the board of referees, may receive a warning, a
        
        forfeit loss or, in extreme cases, be disqualified from the tournament.
        
        Note: Under Any Circumstances, The Decision Of The Administrator Will Be Final And Any Team Not
        
        Agreeing To It Will Be Liable To Disqualification. Rules Are Subject To Change till the Last Minute
        
        According To Admin\'s Discretion. </p></div>
